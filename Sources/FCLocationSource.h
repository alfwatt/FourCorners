    @brief Provides an interface for objects which can provide
    an FCLocation for the current position or translate a string
    into an FCLocation.
 
    @discussion  FCLocationSource is an abstract base class for
    all the location sources in the FourCorners framework it provides
    a generic interface for determining the current location converting
    location description strings to GPS locations and providing position
    and course updates for some location sources.

    Location sources are either singletons tied to the current location of
    the computer and able to convert provided strings into FCLocation objects
    or are tied to a specific local device or network service
